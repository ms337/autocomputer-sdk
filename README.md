A well-structured Python SDK for the AutoComputer Flow API with namespaced routes and strong typing.

## Features

- üîÄ **Namespaced routes**: Access API functionality using intuitive namespaces (e.g., `client.workflows.list()`)
- üìä **Strong typing**: Fully typed request and response objects for better IDE support and error checking
- üîÑ **Async streaming support**: Real-time updates as your workflows execute
- üõ†Ô∏è **Modern Python**: Built with modern Python practices and type annotations

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

To quick start, use AutoComputer's Automation Agent with a workflow that takes a single prompt task asks the agent to perform it. 


Steps: 

1. Create a Venv and install the SDK
2. Set the API key as an env var or in a `.env` file that has been given to you by the AutoComputer team. 
3. Open the runner script (see below) and set the path to the workflow file (see below).
4. Set the `task` input in the runner script. 
4. Run the runner script. This will render UI in the terminal that will start the workflow. 


### Workflow File
The workflow file is in `examples/workflows/single_prompt.json` ‚Äî this is a structured data file that servers as an "automation definition" to AutoComputer. This particular one is definining a workflow that takes a single prompt and runs it. 

Each workflow takes some input parameters ‚Äî¬†i.e. arguments to an automation program. The `single_prompt.json` workflow takes a single parameter called `task` which is the prompt of the task to be performed.

### Runner Script
The runner scirpt is in `examples/remote_single_prompt.py`
